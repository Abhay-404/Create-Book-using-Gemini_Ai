He envied their freedom, their ability to chart their own course in life. Aric longed to escape the stifling confines of his royal duties and experience the world firsthand.

One fateful day, while exploring the castle's vast library, Aric stumbled upon a dusty tome. Its pages held tales of daring adventurers and courageous knights errant. The stories ignited a spark within him, a yearning for adventure that he could no longer deny.

Determined to break free from his royal shackles, Aric devised a daring plan. He would disguise himself as a commoner and venture beyond the castle walls. With the help of his loyal friend, Sir Lucan, he shed his princely attire and donned the simple garb of a traveler.

The battle raged on, the clash of steel against scales echoing through the lair. Alistair's blade found purchase, piercing the dragon's hide and drawing forth its furious roars. Sera's daggers danced across the dragon's exposed flesh, leaving trails of blood in their wake. Eldrin's spells danced through the air, disrupting the dragon's attacks and bolstering the strength of his companions.

As the dragon's strength waned, its fiery breath grew weaker, and its movements became labored. Alistair pressed his advantage, delivering a final, powerful blow that sent the dragon reeling.
